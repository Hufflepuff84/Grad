<h1>Hello, There!</h1>
<p>This is a web application designed for calculating your BMR or basal metabolic rate in calories.
    We are going to use the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
    All credit from this equation is given to those scientists.

    <h2>The Equation for Men is: BMR = 10W + 6.25 H - 5A + 5</h2>
   <h2> The Equation for Women is BMR = 10W + 6.25 H -5A - 161</h2>

    W is the persons weight in kilograms
    H is the persons body height in centimeters
    A is the Age in years
  
    Since we are in the United States we need to know the formula for converting pounds into kilograms
    and the formula for converting feet into centimeters. 
    There are 2.2 pounds in 1 kilograms, and there are 30.48 centimeters in 1 foot.
